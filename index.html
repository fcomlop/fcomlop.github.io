<br>I am currently doing a <b>PhD in Theoretical Neuroscience</b> at the <a href="Frankfurt Institute for Advanced Studies">Frankfurt Institute for Advanced Studies</a>,
working with <a href="https://www.fias.science/en/life-and-neurosciences/research-groups/jochen-triesch/">Prof. Dr. Jochen Triesch</a>
on topics related to <b>Developmental Artificial intelligence</b>. My main research goal is to understand
how infants can autonomously develop sensorimotor control and coordination, using a combination of methods such as intrinsically-motivated reinforcement
learning, unsupervised reprensentations, and hierarchical architectures. I have also developed several open-source research platforms:
<a href="https://github.com/trieschlab/MIMo">MIMo</a>, BabyBench, and OpenEyeSim. 
Check out my publications and projects to learn more.<br><br>

<!--
Previously, I did a <b>Master's in Cognitive Science</b> with Prof. Dr. Andrés Pomi (Cognitive Systems Modeling Group)
and a <b>Bachelor's in Physics</b> with Prof. Dr. Gonzalo Tancredi (Astronomy Group),
both at the Faculty of Science, Universidad de la República, Uruguay. I also collaborated with the research groups of
Prof. Dr. Alejandre Maiche (Interdisciplinary Cognition Center for Education and Learning)
and Prof. Dr. María Castelló (Clemente Estable Biological Research Institute).<br><br>

Besides science, I enjoy running, exploring new cities, and drinking mate.
